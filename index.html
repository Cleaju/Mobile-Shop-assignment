                Coding can seem like a thing only geniuses and geeks can truly master,
                 and learning it might seem like an impossible thing. Bigjara aims to make coding simpler for you, 
                 though.
                  Teaching and providing people new to the coding business with the necessary 
                  information and training is their goal. 

                The brandâ€™s mission is well summed up on their customer testimonial page, 
                with many of their past students sharing their success stories. As a technology business, 
                they use video testimonials to properly showcase what their mission and success stories are all about.

                 people helps encourage others who are unsure about signing up for coding.
